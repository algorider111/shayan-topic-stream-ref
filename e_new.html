  <h2>👋 Introduction</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Shayan</strong> is an International Grandmaster and ICPC World Finalist.</li>
    <li>He went from <strong>Newbie to Expert</strong> in just 3 months (March–June 2015).</li>
    <li>This guide captures the exact steps that helped him and his students.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>✅ 1. Solve Problems Around Your Rating</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't waste time on problems that are too easy or too hard.</li>
    <li>Aim for ~10 problems/day at your own level (~30 mins per problem).</li>
    <li>Sort problems by number of accepts and do the first 5 pages (~400 problems).</li>
    <li>Focus on basic implementation, math, brute force, etc.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🚫 2. Avoid Irrelevant Advanced Topics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Skip complex structures like Segment Trees, Centroid Decomposition, etc.</li>
    <li>These are distractions at this level.</li>
    <li>Stick to solving — not memorizing algorithms.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🔁 3. Master Dynamic Programming (DP)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>DP is essential to reach Expert level.</li>
    <li>Practice variations of DP problems.</li>
    <li>Understand the patterns and transitions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎥 4. Watch Free Topic Streams</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Shayan provides free videos on DP, Graphs, Number Theory, etc.</li>
    <li>First watch topic theory, then watch him solve problems.</li>
    <li>Great for those without strong coaching.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧠 5. Think Before Editorial</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep thinking until you're completely stuck.</li>
    <li>Use the editorial step-by-step — not all at once.</li>
    <li>Learn from small hints instead of spoiling solutions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📚 6. Learn While Solving</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't learn algorithms first.</li>
    <li>Face a problem → Learn while solving it.</li>
    <li>Read other people’s codes for insight.</li>
    <li>This method is how Shayan learned many advanced topics naturally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🧪 7. Never Miss Contests</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Participate in all live contests regularly.</li>
    <li>Don’t delay for “preparation.”</li>
    <li>Upsolve every unsolved contest problem after it ends.</li>
    <li>Use <strong>virtual contests</strong> as mock tests anytime.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📈 Shayan's Success Formula</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Solve 10 problems/day.</li>
    <li>Learn by doing.</li>
    <li>Participate in contests (live + virtual).</li>
    <li>Focus on core topics: DP, Graphs, Number Theory, Greedy.</li>
    <li>Don’t fear rating loss — treat it as feedback.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>🎯 Final Task for You</h2>
  <p>Comment your current rating and target month to become Expert. When the time comes, reply with your result and how the strategy worked for you!</p>
